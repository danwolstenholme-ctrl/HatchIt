**Target Audience:** Web Developers, Freelancers, Founders who hate boilerplating.
**Tone:** "One of us", solving the pain of setup, not over-promising "magic" but delivering "architecture".

## Creative Set 1: The "Honest Dev" Approach
**Subreddits:** r/webdev, r/reactjs, r/SideProject, r/SaaS

**Headline:**
> I got tired of setting up Next.js auth, db, and stripe for the 50th time. So I built an AI Architect that does it.

**Body:**
You know the drill. New idea → `npx create-next-app` → spend 3 days wrestling with Stripe webhooks, Supabase RLS policies, and making the UI not look like garbage.

I built **HatchIt** to kill this loop.

It's not just a "code generator". It's a Context-Aware Architect.
1. You describe the app.
2. It plans the database schema (and explains why).
3. It builds the frontend components (Tailwind 4 + React 19).
4. It wires up the backend services.

It's essentially `npm install founder-mode`.

Try the builder for free. If it sucks, roast me in the comments.

## Creative Set 2: The "Visual/Egg" Hook (Uses the new Logo Concept)
**Subreddits:** r/ui_design, r/frontend

**Headline:**
> From `idea` to `deployed` before your coffee gets cold. 🥚🐣🚀

**Body:**
Stop building empty `<div>`s.

**HatchIt** turns text prompts into full-stack Next.js applications.
*   **Design:** Premium Glassmorphism (Zinc/Emerald) out of the box.
*   **Stack:** Next.js 16, Supabase, Clerk, Stripe.
*   **Code:** Clean, editable, React 19 server components.

This isn't a "no-code" tool where you're locked in. This helps you **hatch** a real codebase that you own and export.

## Creative Set 3: The Short/Punchy (Twitter style)
**Subreddits:** r/indiehackers

**Headline:**
> Your side project graveyard ends today.

**Body:**
Most projects die because setup takes too long and motivation fades.

**HatchIt** handles the boring stuff:
*   ✅ Auth (Clerk)
*   ✅ Database (Supabase)
*   ✅ Payments (Stripe)
*   ✅ UI Components (Tailwind 4)

You handle the logic and the launch.
Stop building the scaffolding. Start building the business.
