# Archived Features

Features that have been removed but should be remembered for future iterations.

## THE DREAM (Idle State Experience)
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE in Builder only (moved 2 Jan 2026)  
**Location:** `components/TheDream.tsx` - rendered in `app/builder/page.tsx`

### Concept
When users go idle for 30 seconds, the Architect starts "dreaming" - a subtle ambient presence showing the AI is always observing, always thinking.

### Where It Lives
- ❌ NOT on marketing pages (homepage, features, etc.)
- ✅ YES in the builder - where users are actually creating
