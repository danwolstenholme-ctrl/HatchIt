## Reddit Post (Long Form - "Show & Tell" / IndieHackers style)

**Title:** I built an AI that writes the "boring" 80% of your Next.js SaaS (Auth, DB, Stripe) so I could focus on the fun part. Free sandbox to try.

**Subreddits:** r/webdev, r/SideProject, r/SaaS, r/NextJS

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

Like many of you, I have a graveyard of side projects. The pattern is always the same:
1.  Get an idea.
2.  Run `create-next-app`.
3.  Spend 3 days setting up Shadcn UI, configuring Supabase, wrestling with Stripe webhooks, and debugging generic Clerk callbacks.
4.  Lose motivation before writing a single line of *actual* business logic.

I realized I wasn't coding; I was just doing configuration management.

So I built **HatchIt**.

**What is it?**
It’s a "Text-to-SaaS" architect. You describe your idea (e.g., *"A job board for underwater welders"*), and it generates a full-stack Next.js application.

But unlike other generators that just give you a landing page, HatchIt builds the actual *guts* of the app:

*   **The Stack:** Next.js 16.1 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind 4, Supabase (Postgres), Clerk (Auth), and Stripe.
*   **The Database:** It writes the SQL schema for you.
*   **The Backend:** It generates server actions and API routes.
*   **The Frontend:** It builds glassmorphic, responsive UI components (not just unstyled HTML).

**The "No-Signup" Promise**
I hate tools that force you to create an account just to see if they work.
I built a **Guest Sandbox** that runs entirely in your browser with local storage previews. You can build, tweak, and play with the AI architect completely free, without giving me your email.

**Why I'm sharing this**
I want to know if this actually solves the "setup fatigue" for other devs, or if I'm just lazy. I’m looking for honest feedback on the code quality it produces. Does it match your standards?

## LinkedIn Post (Professional/Founder Focus)

**Headline:** The "Blank Canvas" problem is dead. The Architect Era is here.

**Body:**

How much engineering time does your team spend on "boilerplate"?

Setting up authentication. Configuring database policies. integrating payment gateways. Aligning UI libraries.

It’s necessary work, but it’s not *valuable* work. It’s plumbing.

We built **HatchIt** to automated the plumbing so engineers can focus on the architecture.

HatchIt is a Context-Aware AI Architect that turns natural language into production-ready full-stack applications.
We aren't talking about static HTML landing pages. We are talking about:

✅ **Next.js 16 & React 19 Server Components**
✅ **Supabase Database Schemas (SQL)**
✅ **Secure Auth Flows (Clerk)**
✅ **Stripe Payment Integration**

We believe the future of development isn't "No-Code". It's **"High-Velocity Code"**. You should own the source code, you just shouldn't have to type every character of setup configuration manually.

**We are opening the doors.**
We've launched a free, no-login Guest Sandbox. You can test the architect's capabilities right now. See how it turns a simple prompt into a deployable SaaS structure in minutes.

## Twitter / X Thread (Bonus)

1/6
I stopped writing boilerplate.
I built an AI to do it for me.
Here is HatchIt: The Text-to-SaaS Architect. 🧵

2/6
The Problem:
Every new project starts with 3 days of "Setup Hell".
- Auth? Config.
- DB? Schema.
- Payments? Webhooks.
By the time I'm done, I'm bored.

3/6
The Solution:
HatchIt generates the entire skeletal structure of a Next.js 16 app from a single prompt.
It gives you the code. It's not a walled garden. You own the repo.

4/6
The Tech:
- Next.js 16.1
- React 19 (Server Components)
- Tailwind 4 (The new engine)
- Supabase + Clerk + Stripe
It uses the stack you actually want to use.

5/6
The Offer:
I made a "Guest Mode".
No login. No credit card.
Just go to the site, type a prompt, and watch it build.

6/6
Stop building scaffolding. Start building the business.
