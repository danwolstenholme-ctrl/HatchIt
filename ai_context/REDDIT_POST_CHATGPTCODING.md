**Title:** Why I built my own AI website builder after a decade of WordPress hell

---

## COPY THIS (Reddit-friendly formatting):

I've been building websites professionally for over 10 years. WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, Figma exports, various "AI builders" — I've tried them all.

They all had the same problem: they controlled the output.

WordPress themes locked me into someone else's design decisions. Drag-and-drop builders created div soup. Export from Figma? 500 lines of CSS for a button. The new wave of AI tools? They wrap everything in 47 nested containers and call it "clean code."

So I built HatchIt.

Not as a startup pitch. Not to raise money. I built it because I was frustrated and I knew exactly what I wanted:

• Real React + Tailwind — Not template garbage. Actual components I'd write myself.

• Live preview while building — Watch it generate section by section, not "wait 30 seconds and pray."

• Iterate without starting over — Don't like the hero? Regenerate just that part.

• One-click deploy — Live URL in seconds. No Vercel config, no FTP, no bullshit.

I've been shipping this thing 18 hours a day since Christmas. Lost track of which day it is. My girlfriend thinks I've lost my mind. Maybe I have.

But here's the thing: it works.

I'm using it for my own client work now. I built a landing page in 15 minutes yesterday that would have taken me 3 hours in WordPress. The code is clean. The sites are fast. I can actually maintain them.

Why am I sharing this?

Because I spent a decade dealing with the same frustrations you probably have. I'm not saying HatchIt is perfect — it's a week old. But it's already better than anything else I've used for rapid prototyping.
