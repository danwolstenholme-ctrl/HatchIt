## Brand Pillars

### 1. TEXT TO REALITY
The user describes what they want, we build it. No configuration, no learning curve.
We bridge the gap between thought and reality.

### 2. THE STUDIO STANDARD
We are a **Professional Studio**, not a "hacker tool."
- UI is crisp, aligned, professional
- Animations are cinematic (Framer Motion), not jittery
- Glassmorphism (`backdrop-blur`, `bg-white/5`) for texture

### 3. THE PROXIMITY PROTOCOL
"The closer to the builder, the more premium we get."
- The Dashboard is a cockpit, not a playground
- **NO EMOJIS** in dashboard/builder UI - use Lucide icons only
- User's work takes center stage - HatchIt branding fades to background

## Voice

**Confident.** We know what we're doing.  
**Precise.** No fluff, no marketing speak.  
**Professional.** Crisp and clean.  
**Empowering.** The user is the creator, we're the instrument.

### Copy Examples
- ❌ "Let's build something amazing together!"
- ✅ "Describe your vision. We'll make it real."

- ❌ "Sign up now for awesome features!"
- ✅ "Start building."

- ❌ "Your project has been successfully created!"
- ✅ "Project created."
